# BefungeJIT
Just in time interpreter for the Befunge programming language written in python. 

##About

> Befunge is a stack-based, reflective, esoteric programming language. It differs from conventional languages in that programs are arranged on a two-dimensional grid. "Arrow" instructions direct the control flow to the left, right, up or down, and loops are constructed by sending the control flow in a cycle. (Wikipedia page on Befunge)
